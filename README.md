# Argon Assault

## Game Mantra:

Stylized 3D space shooter about a rogue pilot escaping from his imperial captors. 

## Design Pillars:

**_Story_:** A game which is primarily lead by it’s narrative. 

**_Exploration_:** A game where the player has free roam control of his ship and access to a spacious map. 

**_Urgency_:** Player is required to complete tasks within a certain time frame, or before they are destroyed by enemy patrol units, whichever comes first. 

## Story/Mechanics:

A simple space free flight mechanic that portrays a sense of player freedom, but a freedom that is fleeting while under enemy duress. This is meant to simulate the turmoil experienced by the main character. Argon Assault also utilizes sound design to convey the intensity of the story.
