# Argon Assault

## Game Mantra:

Stylized 3D space shooter about a rogue pilot escaping from his imperial captors. 

## Design Pillars:

**_Story_:** A game which is primarily lead by it’s narrative. 

**_Exploration_:** The player has free roam capabilities and access to a spacious map. 

**_Urgency_:** Player must be mindful of the time restrictions and find their way to freedom before being destroyed by enemy patrol units. 

## Mechanics:

Includes a free flight mechanic that allows the player to smoothly control their ship and explore their environment. This does not come without its restrictions, however, since the longer the player spends roaming the level the less time the player will have to complete their tasks. This provides a "fleeting freedom" perspective experienced by the main character, who is in constant pursuit of a freedom he never had, only ever receiving glimpses while escaping heavy enemy fire. The player ship includes an artillery range, ammo supply, thrust capabilities and a targeting system.
